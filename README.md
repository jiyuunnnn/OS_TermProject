# AI Speaker

## Project Outline
The program uses speech-to-text(STT) to recognize the user's voice.
Then the program interacts with the OpenAI API to acquire the right response for the user's request.
Lastly, the program outputs the answer in a spoken form using a voice file using text-to-speech(TTS).
